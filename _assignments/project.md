# Final Project
Your task is to as a team create a video game. Your grade for this project is made up of three major deliverables and team meetings with your assigned project mentor every two weeks. The details, dates, and list of documents to be turned in for each are below.

You can find all document templates needed for the project at the [Course Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zdpOJlR6vrDkMdjwJ7bNBdzrqyFAfYJ3?usp=sharing)

## Discovery (10% of project grade)
**Due date: 11:59 PM November 3rd**

Discovery is the phase of your project where your team decides what game you are making and what needs to be accomplished to do so.

You are tasked with turning in three documents: A short description/summary of your project, a high level vision canvas, and a technical design document. All of these should be in the given folder. Submissions should be in the form of PDF files.

Your documents will be graded on:
- Completion - Did you turn in all the documents and were all the documents completed correctly?
- Cohesiveness - Do most of the parts of your project support each other? Are your core pillars supported in your features?
- Feasability - Will you be able to finish your project in the alotted time? Have you made allowances and prioritised features so that you can scale down if needed?
- Clarity - Did you clearly communicate what your project is and what exactly a player will do in your game?


## Mid Project Meetings (5% of project grade)
Every few weeks you will be meeting with your project mentor to give them updates so that they can help you, ask questions, and provide feedback.

Each meeting you will be graded on:
- If you have accomplished tasks since the last meeting
- If you have responded to or implemented the feedback from the previous meeting
- Scheduling, division of work, and general project management 

Meetings will be on:
- October 25th through October 31st (ungraded, introduction, questions, and discovery help)
- November 15th through November 19th
- December 4th through December 8th
