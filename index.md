## Overview ##

This is a team and project-based course on video game design and development using Unreal Engine and C++. Topics covered will include geometric modeling, game physics and AI, shader programming, and software and engineering practices within the game industry. The central  focus of the course will be the design and development of a game by teams of 3 to 5 students. The course strongly empahsizes code development and there are no exams.

#### Prerequisites ####
We recommend the following courses and skills:

- [CS 225](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} - prior general programming experience, preferably using C++
- [Math 257](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/terms/MATH/257){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} - or Math 415 or equivalent...basic linear algebra, especially 3D transforms

## Instructional Content ##

The course will be taught using online lectures along with additional reading materials. There will ba one live online meeting per week that will offer opportunities for extra credit. 

#### Lectures ####

+ Lectures will be available as asynchronous video links posted on the [course schedule](https://illinois-cs498gd.github.io/schedule).
+ **You can attend live lectures/discussions at 11am Central Time on Thursdays at this [Zoom link](https://illinois.zoom.us/j/85721476191?pwd=d2dmZURrcGFvdzh0OEhiOWhMZ2phdz09).**
+ These lectures will be recorded and available on the course schedule.

#### Development Resources ####

You will need to have access to a computer capable of running Unreal Engine. You can test  

## Assessments ##

Assigned work will include 8 quizzes, 2 programming assignments, and a final project.

#### Bi-Weekly Quizes ####
There will be 8 short quizzes on PrairieLearn. These quizzes will be based on the lecture material.
+ **Each quiz can be taken up to 5 times with the maximum score reduced each attempt.  
The maximum credit on the Nth attempt is 100 - 10(N-1)**
+ **They are due at midnight 10 days after they are assigned.**

#### Programming Assignments ####
There will be 2 programming assignments that will serve as an introduction to Unreal.

#### Project ####
The course project will be team-based with teams of 3 to 5 people working on a project. You will have a choice of what to implement, but your proposed project is expected to be related to game development in some way...typically it should be a game. The grading citeria and development process are described on the Project page.

#### 4 Credit Project ####

Students taking the course for 4 credits should select one of the following three options for a 4 credit project:

+ Contribute to the [ILLIXIR project](https://illixr.github.io/), open-source Extended Reality (XR) system and testbed.  
+ Add a new feauture to the Unreal Engine code base, which is available on [Github](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue4-on-github).  
You can find more information about contributing on the [forum](https://forums.unrealengine.com/c/development-discussion/engine-source-github/33). 
+ Develop a plugin or other application suitable for publication in the [Unreal Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/store)
